# Static Website Hosting

## Description

The purpose of the project was to create a S3 Bucket and upload images and host them on a static website.

## Steps Taken

**### 9. S3 Bucket, Properties in the Static Website Hosting section launch the URL in another tab. Received a HTTP Response Code 403 Forbidden as S3 Buckets are Private by default. I needed to grant permissions for any unauthenticated user and the perferred method is use a JSON bucket policy.**

## Result

I successfully rendered a static website using an S3 bucket. 
Initially, I aimed to host the website with a custom DNS, so I followed the naming guidelines and gave the bucket a unique name. However, I mistakenly entered the URL in the bucket name incorrectly, which later caused issues when I tried to connect the bucket to Route53.

Since S3 buckets cannot be renamed without deletion, I decided to leave the project as is. Iâ€™ll take this experience as a lesson and pay closer attention in future projects to avoid similar mistakes.

Despite this, I was able to achieve the primary goal of hosting a static website on S3.
